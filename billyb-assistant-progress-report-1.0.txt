     ‚Ä¢ Installs Python libs and spaCy model
     ‚Ä¢ Copies app code
     ‚Ä¢ CMD ‚Üí python main.py
   - Local registry at localhost:5000 to host image

   - Volumes:
     ‚Ä¢ ./data ‚Üí /app/data
   - Port mapping:
     ‚Ä¢ Host 5001 ‚Üí Container 5000

     ‚Ä¢ Flask app exposing:
       ‚Äì GET/POST /profile for JSON user profile
       ‚Äì GET / ‚Üí personalized greeting
     ‚Ä¢ Data persisted under ./data/user_profile.json

6. Build & Deployment
   - Built image locally: docker build -t billy-assistant:latest .
   - Pushed to registry: docker push localhost:5000/billy-assistant:latest
   - Deployed via Portainer stack ‚Äúbilly-assistant‚Äù
   - Verified endpoint at http://billyb:5001/
     ‚Ä¢ Default greeting when no profile set
     ‚Ä¢ Personalized greeting after POST to /profile

7. Next Steps
   - Add style-based response adaptation using profile ‚Äústyle‚Äù field

- Assistant base URL: http://billyb:5001
- DNS .local not yet configured; using hostname directly.

8. Style-Based Response Adaptation
   - Implemented handling of 'style' in main.py (direct, formal, default).
   - Rebuilt, tagged, pushed image; redeployed via Portainer.
   - Verified style logic via curl tests.

9. Ask Endpoint Stub
   - Added /ask endpoint stub in main.py, echoing user questions.
   - Rebuilt, tagged, pushed image; redeployed stack.
   - Verified stub via curl.

10. Ollama Integration (REST)
   - # Removed local Ollama installation (decommissioned).
   - Added 'requests' to requirements.txt.
   - Updated docker-compose.yml to include Ollama service and GPU reservation.
   - Updated main.py to call Ollama REST API for /ask.
   - Rebuilt, tagged, pushed image; redeployed stack with Portainer.
   - Verified /ask endpoint returns real AI responses from Ollama.


# ----------------------------
# Update: 2025-04-24
# ----------------------------

- Verified Docker-based assistant stack successfully runs Flask app on port 5001.
- Verified Ollama container runs cleanly using latest `ollama/ollama:latest` (v0.6.6).
- Detected breaking change: `/api/generate` and `/api/completions` are unavailable in current image (v0.6.6).
- ‚úÖ Containers communicate via internal DNS (`ollama:11434` resolves successfully).
- ‚ùå Assistant `/ask` endpoint cannot complete due to missing supported API in containerized Ollama.
- üîí **Paused development on `/ask` endpoint pending updated Ollama image with `/api/completions` support.**
- Next steps will proceed with dummy handler to enable continued development/testing of other endpoints.

# ----------------------------
# Update: 2025-04-24
# ----------------------------

- Completed real-time DuckDuckGo search integration.
- Verified functional /search endpoint with query fallback and formatting.
- Optimized Docker build to cache requirements and speed up rebuilds.
- ‚úÖ Cache-tested rebuild pipeline confirmed working.
- Beginning work on /admin routes and persistent query logging:
  - /admin/status for uptime and config
  - /admin/logs for recent activity
  - Query logs saved to data/query_log.json
