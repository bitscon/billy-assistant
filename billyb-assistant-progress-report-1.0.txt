## ⛔ Reversed or Deferred

- [ ] Initial `/ask` integration with Ollama’s `/api/generate` endpoint  
  - ❌ Replaced due to updated Ollama API (`/api/completions`)
  - ❌ Ollama Docker image not yet compatible — **PAUSED**

---

## 🧭 Currently In Progress

- Web search + summarization refinements
- Profile-based personalization
- Enhanced admin logging
- Modular refactor planned

---

## 🔒 Known Constraints

- Ollama must support `/api/completions` in Docker for full LLM use
- DNS resolution between containers must be stable for `OLLAMA_URL`
- `requests`, `flask`, and `subprocess` fully tested — no known runtime bugs

## 🗓️ Progress Report - $(date '+%Y-%m-%d')

### ✅ Major Wins
- Setup of fully automated daily workflow (`billy_alive.sh`)
- Transitioned development off billyb server ➔ to safe local laptop dev environment
- Configured perfect GitHub SSH integration (no more passphrase prompts)
- Simplified Docker build and registry push flows
- Verified all Flask API endpoints after moves (/ask, /search, /summarize, /profile, etc.)
- Created clean README documentation to make future updates simple
- Fully stabilized project to resume work safely and professionally
- Added a "Billy is Alive" desktop shortcut for easy deployments

### ⚙️ Technical Improvements
- Docker image building now done only on server
- Portainer stack updates decoupled from code push
- GitHub operations secured and streamlined
- Improved bash scripting with confirmations, prompts, tips

### ⏸️ Still Pending
- Ollama LLM true connection (waiting for their Docker update)
- Live DNS/SSL (ai.bitsnbytes.lol) pending external setup

🎯 Status: Billy is operational, maintainable, and growing rapidly!
