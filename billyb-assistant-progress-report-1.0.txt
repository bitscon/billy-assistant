## ⛔ Reversed or Deferred

- [ ] Initial `/ask` integration with Ollama’s `/api/generate` endpoint  
  - ❌ Replaced due to updated Ollama API (`/api/completions`)
  - ❌ Ollama Docker image not yet compatible — **PAUSED**

---

## 🧭 Currently In Progress

- Web search + summarization refinements
- Profile-based personalization
- Enhanced admin logging
- Modular refactor planned

---

## 🔒 Known Constraints

- Ollama must support `/api/completions` in Docker for full LLM use
- DNS resolution between containers must be stable for `OLLAMA_URL`
- `requests`, `flask`, and `subprocess` fully tested — no known runtime bugs
