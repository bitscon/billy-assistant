# ðŸ§  Billy Assistant â€” Project Plan

## Overall Goal
Create a self-hosted, dynamic, learning assistant that can:
- Store and retrieve persistent memory
- Accept corrections and evolve over time
- Handle real-world documents, links, and instructions
- Build future AI tools alongside Chad

---

## Phase 1 â€” Infrastructure Foundation

âœ… Modular, extensible architecture  
âœ… Vector memory with semantic search  
âœ… Local, open-source LLM (LLaMA 2 or similar)  
âœ… Core orchestrator loop (retrieve + generate)  
âœ… Self-hosted, private deployment

---

## Current Focus
- Deploy vector database (Qdrant)
- Set up LLM inference (LLaMA 2 or open model)
- Build simple orchestrator (Python + LangChain)
- Enable storing and retrieving information
- Enable user to correct memory manually

## Tool Choices
| Component         | Choice                        |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| LLM (Brain)       | LLaMA 2 13B Chat or similar    |
| Vector DB (Memory) | Qdrant                        |
| Embeddings Model  | SentenceTransformers SBERT    |
| Orchestrator      | Python + LangChain             |
| Containers        | Docker Compose                |

---

## Long-Term Vision
- Steerable learning (editable knowledge)
- Real-time context retrieval
- Plugins for tools (browsing, coding, scheduling)
- Voice control (future phase)
- Fine-tuning and self-training
