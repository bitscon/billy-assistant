# Assistant Project Plan

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Core Assistant Setup
- [x] Flask API created with `/`, `/ask`, `/search`, and `/profile` routes

- [x] /profile responds with greeting and stored info
- [x] /search endpoint stub created

## ‚úÖ Phase 2: Backend Service Integration
- [x] Dockerized assistant and Ollama with isolated services
- [x] Port and bridge networking verified (5001 for Flask, 11434 for Ollama)

## üîÑ Phase 3.1: Admin + Logs (active)
- [ ] `/admin/status` with uptime, profile, config
- [ ] `/admin/logs` to return recent activity
- [ ] Save all `/ask` and `/search` logs to `data/query_log.json` (last 50)

## ‚è© Phase 4: Admin & Profile Tools
- [ ] Persistent user memory volume
- [ ] Editable system personality / toggles
